# Scrittor - A simple note app üëãüèª

### What is this app all about?
Scrittor was made with the intention of keeping the process of note taking simple yet appealing to the eye. I wish to continue the same approach throughout its journey.

### When and How?
I started this project when I was in my last year of college (2016-17). I used to use Google keep back then, however, wanted my own simple note taking application and hence Scrittor was born.

### Why no updates for more than 2 years?
When I got my first job, my priority shifted quickly from Android development to web development. I however remember fixing all the known bugs at that time and the app was fairly stable. However, in the next 1-2 years, Google updated a ton of its libraries and I could not find the time to update the same. However, during the lockdown phase I did try to work on Scrittor, however, my PC died (its still dead) and I being 1 in 3445433 developers did not upload the code to Github. 

### Why open sourcing it now?
I finally was able to somehow locate the files and with the help of my friend, Junaid, updated the app. I realised a lot of people faced issues and I would not want that to happen again and hence I am open sourcing the app so that we can take it further together.

### What tech does it use?
It uses Android SDK and Google Drive for backup.
